# MATH189-Assignment-3
By Brittney Cifuentes-Tello and Justin Nguyen

### Introduction
This repository includes R code, output plots, and a Google Documents paper as part of a statistical study on base pair palindromes in human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA. It is theorized that palindromes can signify origin points of DNA replication which, when located, opens the door to further research on how to better combat the virus.

### Files
`output`: folder containing output plots for each corresponding section in the analysis (represented as a subfolder)
`paper`: folder containing DOCX and PDF versions of the Google Document
`code.R`: R code for loading, processing, performing statistical tests, and plotting graphs of the data
`hcmv.txt`: source data representing palindrome locations along the HCMV DNA sequence
